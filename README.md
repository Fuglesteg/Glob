# Glob

My submission to the Spring Lisp Game Jam 2025
The first game made using [Slither](https://github.com/fuglesteg/slither)

It's a simple game based on [Agar.io](https://agar.io). You eat other blobs to
gain size and be the biggest. You win if you grow big enough to eat the whole
arena.

Glob started out as a test project for shader development using Slither. The intention was to make a screensaver. When the game jam started I though it would be fun to try and turn it into a game.
